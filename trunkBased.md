## Trunk based development

In this Git branching alternative, developers merge small, frequent updates to a core trunk or main branch.

As codebase complexity and team size grow, this alternative helps keep production releases flowing with its streamlines merging and integration phases.

If build and test processes are automated but each developer works isolated from the CI/CD environment with long merge times, continuous integration is not being fully implemented
